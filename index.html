    <h1>The Great Fight : Musk vs Zuck !</h1>
<div class="narrative">
<p>We have to launch tokens on Venom Ecosystem also on BNB-Chain. All tokens will be community driven. No Team Token. No Buy taxes.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I tweeted about META‚Äôs competitor to Twitter called ‚ÄòThreads‚Äô. I took a few jabs at Meta, then referenced their Chief Product Officer saying how they‚Äôve "been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run."</p>
<p>Elon saw the tweet and promptly responded facetiously by saying, "I'm sure Earth can't wait to be exclusively under Zuck's thumb with no other options. At least it will be 'sane.' Was worried there for a moment üòÖ."</p>
<p>A Twitter user responded to Elon‚Äôs comment by saying, "Better be careful, 
@elonmusk I heard he [Zuckerberg] does jujitsu now," to which Elon replied, "I'm up for a cage match if he is lol."</p>

<p>As if this callout by Elon wasn't enough, Zuckerberg responded to Elon's challenge via his Instagram story by saying ‚Äúsend me location," referencing the famous quote from MMA fighter Khabib when he called out Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>We now have additional information about the potential bout. Location: Vegas. It will be fought in an Octagon (UFC style). Potential referee: Joe Rogan. Andrew Tate has offered to train Elon in preparation for the fight. UFC President Dana White claims he spoke to both Elon and Zuckerberg, and both are ‚Äúdead serious‚Äù

What do you think: Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg, WHO WINS? </p>
